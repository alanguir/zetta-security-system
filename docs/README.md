###Glossary

We may end up using some terms that are new to you. Here are their quick definitions and where to find out more about them.

* [Actuator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator): a type of motor that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system.
* [Sensor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor): a device that detects events or changes in quantities and provides a corresponding output.
* Driver: the Zetta representation of a device. It includes a Scout for finding the physical device, and a driver for interacting with the device via javascript.
* Scout: responsible for searching for a physical device, and alerting Zetta to it's existence.
